The Open Source project Sojo has announced the first initial release (version 0.1.0). 
The intention for this project is a Java framework, that convert JavaBeans in a simplified representation . 
So it is easy and uniformly to handle the access to JavaBeans properties. 
The framework want complement POJO's, where Java must communicate with "other worlds. Other worlds are interfaces, 
where object orientation is not supported or is not the best decision.

In cases, where object orientation and not object orientation must work together, exist the problem of independent mismatched. 
The SOJO want to do this problem a little bit smaller.

The Open Source project Sojo has announced the third release (version 0.3.0). 
The intention for this project is a Java framework, that convert JavaBeans in a simplified representation . 
So it is easy and uniformly to handle and control the access to JavaBeans properties. 
This framework want to complement POJOs, where Java communicate with "other worlds. Other worlds are interfaces, 
where object orientation is not supported or is not the best decision.

In cases, where object orientation and not object orientation must work together, exist the problem of independent mismatched. 
The SOJO want to do this problem a little bit smaller. 

The main changes are:

Support for the data interchange format JSON adn XML-RPC and minor bug fixes.

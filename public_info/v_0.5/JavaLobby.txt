SOJO, simplify operations with JavaBeans



Dear Javalobby Community,

The Open Source project SOJO has announced the next release (version 0.5.0). 

This Java framework support operation on JavaBeans. 
So it is easy and uniformly to handle and control the access to JavaBeans properties. 
This framework want to complement POJOs, where object orientation is not supported or is not the best decision.

This framework is developed und tested with Java 2 Platform Standard Edition, v 1.4.2.
The SOJO framework has no dependencies to external libraries!!!

The SOJO framework is available under the Apache License Version 2.0. 

Supported functionality are:
<ul>
<li> data interchange to easy communication with non-Java processes:
[code]
Serializer serializer = new JsonSerializer(); 
// XmlRpcSerializer | ObjectSerializer | CsvSerializer
Object result = serializer.serialize(anObject);
Object anObjectCopy = serializer.deserialize(result);

// simple filtering of properties (build, description)
Object result = serializer.serialize(car, new String[] { "build", "description" });
[/code]

<li> operations with complex Java-Objects-graphs (common / navigation):
<ul>
<li> copy or clone complex object graph (for data transfer objects (DTO), can manage different versions from one object graph (object history))
[code]
Object anObjectCopy = new ObjectUtil().copy(anObject);
[/code]
<li> compare complex object graph
[code]
boolean equals = ObjectUtil.equals(obj1, obj2);

// show the first finded different value
CompareResult result = ObjectUtil.compare(obj1, obj2);

// show all finded different value
CompareResult result[] = ObjectUtil.compareAll(obj1, obj2);

// less, equal, greater (for JavaBeans too)
int compareTo = ObjectUtil.compareTo(obj1, obj2);
[/code]
</ul>
</ul>


The main new feature:
- Sort List, Set, Map and Array there contains JavaBeans (Feature Request: 1673100)
- Support for filtering by equals, hashCode and compare methods (Feature Request: 1692337)
- Support for regexp by filtering (Feature Request: 1706577)
- many bug fixes




Have fun with SOJO and say, 
where should the way from SOJO go in future?

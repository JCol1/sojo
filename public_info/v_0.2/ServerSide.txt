Complement POJO with SOJO?

The intention for this project is a Java framework, that convert JavaBeans in a simplified representation . 
So it is easy and uniformly to handle and control the access to JavaBeans properties. 

This framework want to complement POJOs, where Java must communicate with "other worlds". Other worlds are interfaces, 
where object orientation is not supported or is not the best decision.

In cases, where object orientation and not object orientation must work together, exist the problem of independent mismatched. 
The SOJO want to do this problem a little bit smaller. 

Examples are:


* data interchange: 
	- JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) a lightweight data-interchange format 
	- Object To XML - where is XML-RPC a special case 
	- Java serialization, without implements the interface java.io.Serializable 
	  (e.g. cluster, cache, remote communication, ...) 
* operation of complex Java-Objects-graphs: 
	- copy or clone from a complex object graph (can manage different versions from one object graph (object history)) 
	- compare complex object graph 
	- walk over object graph (to traverse) 
	- easy navigate on the complex object graph (with a navigation language) 
* remote acces/communication: 
	- HTTP protocol - request and response are based on String represantation 
	- RMI (Java-Object must serializable (marshalling) or deserializable (unmarshalling)) 
	- WebService or XML RPC - convert Java-Object in special String represantation, in XML 
	- create "value objects" or "transfer objects" to sent objects over the network 
* data access: 
	- object/relational persistence respectively object/relational mapping 
	- flat files (convert Java-Object-Graph to a flat represantation) 
	- property files (e.g. convert Strings to Long, Date, ... by reading a property file and map the value to setter from a Bean) 
	- legacy systems 
* GUI interface: 
	- transform business models to GUI-models (DataBinder) 
	- every changes on the GUI-model must to notice (integrated PropertyChangeListener or VetoableChangeListener)

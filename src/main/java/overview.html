<a href="http://sojo.sourceforge.net">SOJO</a> - <b>S</b>implify your <b>O</b>ld <b>J</b>ava <b>O</b>bjects. 


The intention for this project is a Java framework, that convert 
<a href="http://java.sun.com/products/javabeans/">JavaBeans</a> in a simplified representation.
So it is easy and uniformly to handle the access to JavaBeans properties. 
<br><br>
The aim from this framework is, to provide a "pluggable" basis to integrate different kind of conversions 
(also your own implementations). 
With this infrastructure can solve problems, where POJOs are not supported or are not the best decision. 
<br><br>
Supported is a simple transformation from simple types (how String, read from text or property file) 
to other simple type (Long, Double, ...). 
But also supported are major problems how convert complex Java-Object graphs to a desired (simplified) types.
